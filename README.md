# Image Segmentation Labs

**A Python-based project implementing practical laboratories for image segmentation techniques inspired by the book *Image Segmentation: Principles, Techniques, and Applications* by Tao Lei and Asoke K. Nandi.**

## 📖 **Overview**
This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks, each corresponding to a chapter of the book. The laboratories cover:
- Principles of image segmentation.
- Clustering methods.
- Mathematical morphology.
- Neural networks for segmentation.
- Applications in traffic, medical, remote sensing, and material analysis.
